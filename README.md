# üåü Equilix - VS Code Extension

Equilix extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension enhances the editing experience by automatically equality/inequality operators from `==` to `===` and `!=` to `!==` on save.

## ‚ú® Features

- Conversion of equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) operators to strict equality (`===`) and strict inequality (`!==`).
- Real-time feedback with an on-save popup notification indicating the successful conversion.

## Eliminates Manual ESLint Setup:

- With Equilix, there's no need to manually run ESLint with the --fix flag modify package.json scripts. Equilix seamlessly integrates into Visual Studio Code and automatically applies the necessary code transformations on save. This eliminates the extra steps of running ESLint separately and simplifies the development workflow.
  By using Equilix, you can avoid the hassle of configuring and running ESLint with --fix, setting up scripts in package.json, and ensuring consistent execution across different environments. Equilix provides a more straightforward and streamlined approach to code transformations, making the process quicker and more convenient.

‚ùóÔ∏è Note

While Equilix offers a simplified alternative for specific code transformations, it's important to recognize that ESLint remains a robust tool for code linting, offering extensive rule sets, customizability, and integration with various development environments. Depending on your project's complexity and specific requirements, ESLint might be the preferred choice to enforce a wider range of coding standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Equilix is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript and TypeScript: The core functionality and extension API are implemented using JavaScript and TypeScript, providing a robust and efficient codebase.

- Visual Studio Code Extension API: Equilix leverages the powerful Visual Studio Code Extension API to integrate seamlessly into the editor, allowing automatic code transformations on save.

- Regular Expressions: The conversion logic relies on regular expressions to identify and replace var, ==, and != occurrences, ensuring accurate and efficient transformations.

## üìã Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.56.0 or above.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "Equilix" and click Install.
4. Reload Visual Studio Code to activate the extension.

## üéØ Usage

1. Open a JavaScript file (.js) in Visual Studio Code.
2. As you save the file, Equilix will automatically convert and `==` to `===` and `!=` to `!==`.
3. If any conversions are made, a success notification popup will be displayed will the line number where that conversion happened

## üéØUsage(if above method does not work)

1. Open a JavaScript file (.js) in Visual Studio Code.
2. If On save it does not automarically convert them open command pallete `(cntrl+shift+p)` and type equilix
3. Press `enter` and you will see a error stating that `wrong command` press `ok`
4. Now again on save , your extension should be enable

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Equilix does not require any additional configuration. It works out of the box with the default settings.
